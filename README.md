Quick and dirty implementation of DPLL in order to calculate number of nodes visited in a full tree.

Literal has static objects for 4 positive literals and their complements.\
Literals are hardcoded.\
Add literals to Literals[][], compile and run.\
This implementation runs for the full tree, and doesn't stop on true, so it can return the number of nodes in the DPLL tree.\
DPLL overloads:
```java
DPLL.runDPLL(clauselist);
DPLLL.runDPLL(clauselist, boolean verbosity);
DPLL.runDPLL(clauselist, int verbosityLevel);   // 1-3
```

Algorithm:
```
if (emptySet) return true\
if (hasEmptyClause)  return false\
if for some literal l, {l} is an element of Set then\
    set all l true, -l false\
    return new clause\
    // IF MULTIPLE APPLIES, GET FIRST IN LEXICOGRAPHICAL ORDER
if for some literal l element of Set
    if -l is not element of Set
        set all l true, -l false
        return new clause
    // IF MULTIPLE APPLIES, GET FIRST IN LEXICOGRAPHICAL ORDER
get first literal in lexicographical order and return
    Set where l=1 Ì›AND Set where l=0
```
The use of AND in the final route is specifically so all nodes are visited.


Possible updates:
- Change Lists to Sets
- More comfortable input (not hardcoded)
- Cleaner handling of Literals
- Verbosity levels
